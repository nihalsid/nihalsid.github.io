Hi! I'm Yawar, presently a PhD candidate at the [Visual Computing and Artificial Intelligence](https://niessnerlab.org/) group of [Prof. Matthias Niessner](https://niessnerlab.org/members/matthias_niessner/profile.html) at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/), Germany. My work focuses on 3D reconstruction, scene understanding and 3D generative models.

Before the PhD, I did my Bachelors in Computer Science at [Jamia Millia Islamia](https://www.jmi.ac.in/), followed by a 2 year stint at [Adobe Systems](https://www.adobe.com/) in India, and an Masters in Informatics at [TUM](https://www.tum.de/en/). 

In the past I've had the pleasure of interning with [Thabo Beeler](https://thabobeeler.com/) and [Derek Bradley](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/~bradleyd/) at [Disney Research](https://studios.disneyresearch.com/) in Zurich, and with [Peter Konschieder](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CxbDDRMAAAAJ&hl=en) at [Meta Reality Labs](https://about.meta.com/realitylabs/), also in Zurich.
