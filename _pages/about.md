Hi! I'm Yawar, presently an AI Research Scientist (intern) at [GenAI, Meta](https://ai.meta.com/genai/) in London. I did my PhD at the [Visual Computing and Artificial Intelligence](https://niessnerlab.org/) group of [Prof. Matthias Niessner](https://niessnerlab.org/members/matthias_niessner/profile.html) at the [Technical University of Munich](https://www.tum.de/en/), Germany. My work focuses on 3D reconstruction, scene understanding and 3D generative models.

Before the PhD, I did a Masters in Informatics at [TUM](https://www.tum.de/en/), Germany, and my Bachelors in Computer Science at [Jamia Millia Islamia](https://www.jmi.ac.in/), New Delhi, India, graduating with high distinction and at the top of the class respectively.

In the past, I have worked with [Adobe Systems](https://www.adobe.com/) in India as a software engineer. During my time at TUM, I've had the pleasure of interning with [Thabo Beeler](https://thabobeeler.com/) and [Derek Bradley](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/~bradleyd/) at [Disney Research](https://studios.disneyresearch.com/) in Zurich, and with [Peter Konschieder](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=CxbDDRMAAAAJ&hl=en) at [Meta Reality Labs](https://about.meta.com/realitylabs/), also in Zurich.
